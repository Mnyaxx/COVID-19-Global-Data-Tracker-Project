## 💡 Insights & Reflections

* India experienced a rapid rise in total cases in 2021.
* The United States had consistently high daily new cases.
* Kenya’s vaccination progress showed a slower but steady increase.
* Visualizing the death rate helped highlight the healthcare response in each country.
* Working with real-world data showed the importance of cleaning and handling missing values properly.
* The United States had more cases and deaths than both India and Kenya, despite expectations that India might lead due to its population size.
* Surprisingly, India had a higher rollout of vaccines than the United States.
* Kenya reported the fewest cases, deaths, and vaccination rollouts among the three countries.
